Acoustic Software Developer Intern
• Created Python scripts to simulate various acoustic conditions to test noise-cancelling
technology with voice recognition services.
• Created testing scripts that called AWS Transcribe, Google Speech-to-Text, CMU Sphinx,
and Sensory TrulyHandsFree and aggregated the results together.
• Improved in-house C++ utility scripts for the voice-enhancement library.
