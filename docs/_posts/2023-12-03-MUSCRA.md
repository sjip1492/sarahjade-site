description: As a research assistant studying polyrhythmic music, I worked closely with Dr. Ãˆve Poudrier, whose work in the area of rhythm, cognition, and entrainment was instrumental in shaping my perspective of the pervasiveness of rhythm, and the immersive potential of rhythmic cues in user interfaces. I was an acknowledged contributor to her paper 'Modeling Rhythmic Complexity in a Corpus of Polyrhythm Examples from Europe and America, 1900-1950' which investigated the historical factors impacting contemporary Western art music's rhythmic structures. Used ArcGIS Desktop/Online to analyze and visualize the geographic aspect of these historic trends.
