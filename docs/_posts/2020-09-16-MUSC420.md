This was my capstone project for the AMT Minor, supervised by Professors Keith Hamel and Bob Pritchard.

Echo Chamber combines my interest in 3D computer graphics and digital audio. Echo Chamber is an interactive delay module that musicians can use to create a self-sustaining sound influenced by simulated room acoustics and collision detection. It uses 3D models of different spaces and user input of samples/projectiles that collide with each other to trigger a series of sounds and audio manipulations. The outcome is a standalone tool that is game-like and interesting to use.

Preview images and video coming soon.
