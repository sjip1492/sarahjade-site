description: During my internship at Blackberry QNX as an audio software developer, my team worked on creating a more immersive and sound-isolated environment for concurrent users to interface with AI virtual assistants. I created a test framework in Python for proprietary voice enhancing and noise-control technology that is used in release testing. I incorporated programmatic audio processing to consistently simulate acoustic conditions. I then quantified the algorithm's performance by aggregating the results of several voice recognition services such as AWS Transcribe, Google Speech-to-Text, CMU Sphinx, and Sensory TrulyHandsFree.
