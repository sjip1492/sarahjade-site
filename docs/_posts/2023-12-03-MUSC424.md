description: This was a collaborative project for the Applied Music Technology core course "Interactive Performance Systems." This piece tells the story of the Filipino creation myth and is underscored by reactive audio and visuals. The movements of the dancers were linked to both the sound and the graphics throuugh accelerometers placed on various limbs.

The visual system was programmed by me, using Max/MSP and Jitter.
A few surge protectors may have been harmed during the course of this project.
