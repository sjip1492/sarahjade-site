description: As part of an agile, fast-paced team, I implemented significant portions of the site redesign, maintaining adherence to in-house styling guides and coding conventions. Worked with designers and product managers to ensure the applicationâ€™s ease of use, accessibility,  intuitiveness, informed through user testing feedback and A/B testing results. Was additionally responsible for bi-weekly deployment for each application at the end of each sprint.
