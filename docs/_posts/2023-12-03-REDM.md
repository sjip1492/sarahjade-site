description: As a software developer at RedMane Technology, a social services software company, I took part in the entire lifecycle of an application, from planning and design to post-deployment maintenance and support. I had the privilege to gather user feedback from our clients, a diverse group of social and healthcare workers with varying levels of exposure to digital interfaces. As a result, I have developed a nuanced understanding of the consequences of design decisions on user experience and perception â€” a foundation I believe essential to the field of human-computer interaction research.
