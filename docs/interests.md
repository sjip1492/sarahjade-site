header_text: My ideal user interface...
---

If I had to describe my ideal user interface it would probably be a lump of clay. My recent interest in pottery, specifically wheel-throwing and hand-building ceramics, has been extremely instructive in what qualities I believe to be important in a user interface. Our hands have evolved to seek information and store complex muscle memory, I believe user interfaces should use this to their advantage. The potential benefits include more inclusive user design, improved focus and mental clarity, quicker ability to learn new concepts, etc.

My research interests primarily revolve around the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically focusing on enhancing user experience through immersive, intuitive, and sensory-rich digital interfaces.

My aim is to develop digital experiences that are more aligned with human sensory and cognitive systems, making them more immersive and user-friendly.

Key Interests:

Enhancing Digital User Experience: Focusing on making digital experiences more immersive and seamless.

Integrative HCI Designs: Exploring sensory inputs and motor responses in HCI.

Artificial Intelligence in HCI: Investigating the role of AI in improving user interfaces and experiences.

Tactile and Sensory Technologies: Utilizing tactile and sensory inputs to enrich user interfaces.

User-Centered Design: Prioritizing adaptive and user-friendly technology.

Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Working across various domains to enhance HCI research and development.
